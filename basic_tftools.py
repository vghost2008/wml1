                             parallel_iterations=32, back_prop=True):
  """Runs map_fn as a (static) for loop when possible.

  This function rewrites the map_fn as an explicit unstack input -> for loop
  over function calls -> stack result combination.  This allows our graphs to
  be acyclic when the batch size is static.
  For comparison, see https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/map_fn.

  Note that `static_or_dynamic_map_fn` currently is not *fully* interchangeable
  with the default tf.map_fn function as it does not accept nested inputs (only
  Tensors or lists of Tensors).  Likewise, the output of `fn` can only be a
  Tensor or list of Tensors.

  TODO(jonathanhuang): make this function fully interchangeable with tf.map_fn.

  Args:
    fn: The callable to be performed. It accepts one argument, which will have
      the same structure as elems. Its output must have the
      same structure as elems.
    elems: A tensor or list of tensors, each of which will
      be unpacked along their first dimension. The sequence of the
      resulting slices will be applied to fn.
    dtype:  (optional) The output type(s) of fn. If fn returns a structure of
      Tensors differing from the structure of elems, then dtype is not optional
      and must have the same structure as the output of fn.
    parallel_iterations: (optional) number of batch items to process in
      parallel.  This flag is only used if the native tf.map_fn is used
      and defaults to 32 instead of 10 (unlike the standard tf.map_fn default).
    back_prop: (optional) True enables support for back propagation.
      This flag is only used if the native tf.map_fn is used.

  Returns:
    A tensor or sequence of tensors. Each tensor packs the
    results of applying fn to tensors unpacked from elems along the first
    dimension, from first to last.
  Raises:
    ValueError: if `elems` a Tensor or a list of Tensors.
    ValueError: if `fn` does not return a Tensor or list of Tensors
