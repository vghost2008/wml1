r"""Definition of the DataLoader and associated iterators that subclass _BaseDataLoaderIter

To support these two classes, in `./_utils` we define many utility methods and
functions to be run in multiprocessing. E.g., the data loading worker loop is
in `./_utils/worker.py`.

相对于torch.DataLoader的改进点
1, 原始dataloader的处理流程为主进程采样，工作进程处理，主进程取工作进程的结果数据，在取数据时
取的顺序与采样的顺序一致，为了保持这种一致会导致工作进程无法满负荷运行，数据处理效率底，同时由于
采样大多为随机采样，保持这种顺序并不是十分必要，因些这里删除了顺序一致性的要求；
2，原始的dataloader按顺序给工作进程分派任务，而不考虑工作进程的实际状态，这时修改为按工作进程的排队
任务状态分配任务；
3，原始dataloader生成数据的粒度为一个batch, 当工作进程数较多是会导致工作进程已经处理了大量的数据，
但主进程却无法取到任何一个完整的batch而引起训练阻塞，产生的效果就是工作进程数据多了之后，数据处理反
而变慢了，这里引入一个参数batch_split_nr，让工作进程以batch_size/batch_split_nr的粒度进行数据数据；
4, 当batch size较大时，数据从CPU复制到GPU时会消耗不少时间，这里在pin_memory时，直接将数据复制到GPU;

参数设置参考
1, num_workers设置为4~32
2, pin_memory设置True
3, batch_split_nr设置为4左右（需要能整除batch_size)
4, ulimit -n 65535 #设置可以打开的最大文件数

class DataLoader(Generic[T_co]):
    r"""
    Data loader. Combines a dataset and a sampler, and provides an iterable over
    the given dataset.

    The :class:`~torch.utils.data.DataLoader` supports both map-style and
    iterable-style datasets with single- or multi-process loading, customizing
    loading order and optional automatic batching (collation) and memory pinning.

    See :py:mod:`torch.utils.data` documentation page for more details.

    Args:
        dataset (Dataset): dataset from which to load the data.
        batch_size (int, optional): how many samples per batch to load
            (default: ``1``).
        shuffle (bool, optional): set to ``True`` to have the data reshuffled
            at every epoch (default: ``False``).
        sampler (Sampler or Iterable, optional): defines the strategy to draw
            samples from the dataset. Can be any ``Iterable`` with ``__len__``
            implemented. If specified, :attr:`shuffle` must not be specified.
        batch_sampler (Sampler or Iterable, optional): like :attr:`sampler`, but
            returns a batch of indices at a time. Mutually exclusive with
            :attr:`batch_size`, :attr:`shuffle`, :attr:`sampler`,
            and :attr:`drop_last`.
        num_workers (int, optional): how many subprocesses to use for data
            loading. ``0`` means that the data will be loaded in the main process.
            (default: ``0``)
        collate_fn (callable, optional): merges a list of samples to form a
            mini-batch of Tensor(s).  Used when using batched loading from a
            map-style dataset.
        pin_memory (bool, optional): If ``True``, the data loader will copy Tensors
            into CUDA pinned memory before returning them.  If your data elements
            are a custom type, or your :attr:`collate_fn` returns a batch that is a custom type,
            see the example below.
        drop_last (bool, optional): set to ``True`` to drop the last incomplete batch,
            if the dataset size is not divisible by the batch size. If ``False`` and
            the size of dataset is not divisible by the batch size, then the last batch
            will be smaller. (default: ``False``)
        timeout (numeric, optional): if positive, the timeout value for collecting a batch
            from workers. Should always be non-negative. (default: ``0``)
        worker_init_fn (callable, optional): If not ``None``, this will be called on each
            worker subprocess with the worker id (an int in ``[0, num_workers - 1]``) as
            input, after seeding and before data loading. (default: ``None``)
        prefetch_factor (int, optional, keyword-only arg): Number of samples loaded
            in advance by each worker. ``2`` means there will be a total of
            2 * num_workers samples prefetched across all workers. (default: ``2``)
        persistent_workers (bool, optional): If ``True``, the data loader will not shutdown
            the worker processes after a dataset has been consumed once. This allows to
            maintain the workers `Dataset` instances alive. (default: ``False``)
        batch_split_nr: Each element in data_queue's sample number reduced from batch_size to
            batch_size/batch_split_nr


    .. warning:: If the ``spawn`` start method is used, :attr:`worker_init_fn`
                 cannot be an unpicklable object, e.g., a lambda function. See
                 :ref:`multiprocessing-best-practices` on more details related
                 to multiprocessing in PyTorch.

    .. warning:: ``len(dataloader)`` heuristic is based on the length of the sampler used.
                 When :attr:`dataset` is an :class:`~torch.utils.data.IterableDataset`,
                 it instead returns an estimate based on ``len(dataset) / batch_size``, with proper
                 rounding depending on :attr:`drop_last`, regardless of multi-process loading
                 configurations. This represents the best guess PyTorch can make because PyTorch
                 trusts user :attr:`dataset` code in correctly handling multi-process
                 loading to avoid duplicate data.

                 However, if sharding results in multiple workers having incomplete last batches,
                 this estimate can still be inaccurate, because (1) an otherwise complete batch can
                 be broken into multiple ones and (2) more than one batch worth of samples can be
                 dropped when :attr:`drop_last` is set. Unfortunately, PyTorch can not detect such
                 cases in general.

                 See `Dataset Types`_ for more details on these two types of datasets and how
                 :class:`~torch.utils.data.IterableDataset` interacts with
                 `Multi-process data loading`_.

    .. warning:: See :ref:`reproducibility`, and :ref:`dataloader-workers-random-seed`, and
                 :ref:`data-loading-randomness` notes for random seed related questions.

        # This function check whether the dataloader's worker number is rational based on
        # current system's resource. Current rule is that if the number of workers this
        # Dataloader will create is bigger than the number of logical cpus that is allowed to
        # use, than we will pop up a warning to let user pay attention.
        #
        # eg. If current system has 2 physical CPUs with 16 cores each. And each core support 2
        #     threads, then the total logical cpus here is 2 * 16 * 2 = 64. Let's say current
        #     DataLoader process can use half of them which is 32, then the rational max number of
        #     worker that initiated from this process is 32.
        #     Now, let's say the created DataLoader has num_works = 40, which is bigger than 32.
        #     So the warning message is triggered to notify the user to lower the worker number if
        #     necessary.
        #
        #
        # [Note] Please note that this function repects `cpuset` only when os.sched_getaffinity is
        #        available (available in most of Linux system, but not OSX and Windows).
        #        When os.sched_getaffinity is not available, os.cpu_count() is called instead, but
        #        it doesn't repect cpuset.
        #        We don't take threading into account since each worker process is single threaded
        #        at this time.
        #
        #        We don't set any threading flags (eg. OMP_NUM_THREADS, MKL_NUM_THREADS, etc)
        #        other than `torch.set_num_threads` to 1 in the worker process, if the passing
        #        in functions use 3rd party modules that rely on those threading flags to determine
        #        how many thread to create (eg. numpy, etc), then it is caller's responsibility to
        #        set those flags correctly.
